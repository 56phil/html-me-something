                    My current home. Kansas City is composed of several neighborhoods, including the River Market District in the north, Zona Rosa near the airport, the 18<sup>th</sup> and Vine District in the east, and the Country Club Plaza in the south. The city is also known for its cuisine (including its distinctive style of barbecue), its craft breweries and its major league sports teams.

                    Of all the cities where I have worked, Kansas City is a easily my favorite. The real estate prices are relatively low, the taxes are not too bad, and the people are friendly. Not only is it a great place to visit, it's a fantastic place to live. I am not eager to leave.

                  Not long after I started working for American Airlines, I realized that I would never fit in there. The company was great, the taxes were low, but I would never be accepted in Texas. There are just too many people there that believe the phrase "damned Yankee" is really one word.

                  Springfield, Illinois is also the state capitol. I got my first IT job, and a great deal of IT education, in that city. That initial job was hanging tapes on the midnight shift at the central IT facility for the state. After a few years, I became a COBOL/IMS programmer for The Department of Rehabilitation Services. After several years there, it was off to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex to work for American Airlines as a programmer for their reservation system.

                  Attended my first symphony concert here. Boston has many attractions. I was there a long time ago, in the early 1970s. The only two significant events I recall are a visit to the <a href="https://www.mos.org/"><em>Boston Museum of Science</em></a>, and attending a concert by the <a href="https://www.bso.org/"><em>Boston Symphony Orchestra</em></a>. Everything else is just a blur, now. Like most large cities, Boston is a very expensive place to live.

                  <a href="https://www.si.edu/"><em>The Smithsonian Institution</em></a>, in my opinion, is the crown jewel of the United States. When I had the honor of serving the nation, I was stationed near Washington, D.C. The highpoint of my many visits has to be when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu_Flying_Horse"><em>The Flying Horse of Gansu</em></a> was on display at the National Gallery of Art. The grace and balance of that sculpture touched me deeply. It is a truly great work of art. Since it is unlikely to leave mainland China again, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have seen it.

                  There are so many things to see and do in Washington that all of them cannot be listed here. There are many museums besides the Smithsoniain's collection. They are nice: I visited a few. However, nothing touched me the way that flying horse did. The only work of art that has ever came close was Rembrandt's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Helmet"><em/>The Man with the Golden Helmet</em></a>.

                  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba has (Gitmo) been a base for the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/">U.S. Navy</a> since the Spanish-American War. I was there long before it became an infamous detention facility for alleged terrorist. At the time, it primary mission was being a training base, focused on making crews and ships combat ready. Not much time for sleep in that situation. Mass quantities of caffeine were consumed there, and everyone was happy to put that experience behind them.

                  that received a great deal my free time and far too much of my money. They had a backgammon area that I used to augment my modest means as an enlistee in the U S. Navy. At least, that was my plan. The results were mixed. Some days you eat the bear, and some days the bear eats you.
