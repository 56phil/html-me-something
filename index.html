                      Springfield, Illinois, best known for being the home of the sixteenth president, is also the state capitol. I got my first IT job, and a great deal of IT education, in that city. That initial job was hanging tapes on the midnight shift at the central IT facility for the state. After a few years, I became a COBOL/IMS programmer for The Department of Rehabilitation Services. After several years there, it was off to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex to work for American Airlines as an Airline Control Program (ACP) developer for their flight operations system.

                      Not long after I started working for American Airlines, I realized that I would never fit in there. The company was great, the taxes were low, but I would never be accepted in Texas. There are just too many people there that believe the phrase "damned Yankee" is really one word. When a group of managers for a newly formed partnership between Northwest Airlines and TWA came down to Dallas to raid American's talent pool, I was ready.

                          My current home. Kansas City is composed of several neighborhoods, including the River Market District in the north, Zona Rosa near the airport, the 18<sup>th</sup> and Vine District in the east, and the Country Club Plaza in the south. The city is also known for its cuisine (including its distinctive style of barbecue), its craft breweries and its major league sports teams.

                          Of all the cities in which I have worked, Kansas City is easily my favorite. The real estate prices are relatively low, the taxes are not too bad, and the people are friendly. Not only is it a great place to visit, it's a fantastic place to live. I am not eager to leave.

                        Attended my first symphony performance here. Boston has many attractions. I was there a long time ago, in the early 1970s. The only two significant events I recall are a visit to the <a href="https://www.mos.org/"><em>Boston Museum of Science</em></a>, and going to a concert by the <a href="https://www.bso.org/"><em>Boston Symphony Orchestra</em></a>. I don't remember what was on the program, but I did have a fantastic seat. Everything else is just a blur, now. Like most large cities, Boston is a very expensive place in which to live. Real estate prices and taxes are quite high.

                        <a href="https://www.si.edu/"><em>The Smithsonian Institution</em></a>, in my opinion, is the crown jewel of the United States. When I had the honor of serving the nation, I was stationed near Washington, D.C. The highpoint of my many visits has to be when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu_Flying_Horse"><em>The Flying Horse of Gansu</em></a> was on display at the National Gallery of Art. The grace and balance of that sculpture touched me deeply. It is a truly great work of art. Since it is unlikely to leave mainland China again, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have seen it.

                      <p>
                        There are so many things to see and do in Washington that all of them cannot be listed here. There are many museums besides the Smithsonian's collection. They are nice: I visited a few. However, nothing touched me the way that flying horse did. The only work of art that has ever came close was Rembrandt's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Helmet"><em/>The Man with the Golden Helmet</em></a>.

                        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba has (Gitmo) been a base for the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/">U.S. Navy</a> since the Spanish-American War. I was there as a quartermaster aboard the USS Ponce (LPD-15), long before it became an infamous detention facility for alleged terrorist. At the time. Its primary mission was that of a training base, focused on making crews and ships combat ready, There wasn't much time for sleep in that situation. Mass quantities of caffeine was consumed there. Everyone was happy to put that experience behind them. The time I had there wasn't all sleepless watch standing at my general quarters station in the chart room. There were a few times we got to stand down to recharge. Many members of the crew, including myself, went sailing on the ship's sail boats, fifteen-foot Lasers. Snorkeling in the bay was also an option. There were a couple port calls on that journey. One was to Montego Bay, in Jamaica. The other, my favorite, was to Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

                        There's a lot of history in Philadelphia. Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States, who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitution in 1787. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C., was under construction.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Philadelphia, like most cities, has a street named  2<sup>nd</sup>. On that street there is a fairly classy drinking establishment named
                        <a href="http://www.khyberpasspub.com/"><em>The Khyber Pass Pub</em></a>.
                        I spent too much free time in that place, and far too much money. The pub had a backgammon area that I used to augment my modest means as an enlistee in the U S. Navy. At least, that was my plan. The results were mixed. Some days you eat the bear, and some days the bear eats you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Given all that, my fondest memory during the nearly two years the Ponce was being refitted at the Sun Ship Building and Dry Dock Company, located in nearby Chester, is the food. Many of my dinners consisted of a cheese stake sandwich washed down with a quart of beer. While being a Quartermaster trapped on dry land, my time in the Navy could have been a lot worse.
